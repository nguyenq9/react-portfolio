      "description": "Our proposed solution is to create a mobile app that is used to track where and when you catch a fish. The mobile app will take your GPS location and what fish, crab, etc. you catch and then send it to our server which will store all of the data for you to input at the end of the season. Furthermore, as a future stretch goal, we would like to work with local wildlife management facilities and create a way to automatically send in the information at the end of the season so there is no need for user input. Lastly, the user will be able to look at all of the catches they have logged which will be displayed in a list-like fashion. ",
